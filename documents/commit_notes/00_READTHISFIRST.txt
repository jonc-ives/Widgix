I am, with a few inconsequential exceptions, a self-taught developer. Being so,
I expect those with a more traditional experience in computer-science will find
that much of the (human) language I use, and many of the programming semantics
I employ are at the least annoying, and (hopefully not) in some cases detrimental
to the purpose of this application. Therefore, I have done my best to keep this
application as well-organized and documented as I know how, and I am open to any
conversation regarding the style, semantics, organization, and documentation of
this project that will result in a reasonable improvement in its readability and
workability.

Anybody with an interest in using, understanding, or adapting this project should
feel free to reach out to me, especially if there are any specific questions I
could answer. I do, after all, look for every opportunity to feel important.
