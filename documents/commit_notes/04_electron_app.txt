DEV04 STATUS
	- Basic interface built, renders with flash (fix later)
	- Encountered electron bug with clipboard copy. Will add workaround to issues
	- Pane Templates built. Dynamically loads from ipcmain stubs
	- Full interaction, except widEdit, widPreview, widCopyURL, launched to ipcmain
		- no return management
	- Application loads widgets and modules from file, creates bound panes

NEXT STEPS
	- Create shell module (to be template) with full workflow implementation
		- module modal workflow, renderer handle return
		- widget modal workflow, renderer handle return
		- delete widget workflow, renderer handle return
		- workflow logging --> integration with renderer console

	This is basically filling out the template module, the Process Manager methods
	for the modal workflows, and the renderer's handling of the modal workflow returns.
