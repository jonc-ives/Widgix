Data Object Model successfully built. Application entry at widgix.js, manages configuration and location
of local user assets. Instantiates three primary application model objects:
	- (express.js).ApplicationServiceManager
	- (logging.js).ApplicationLogManager
	- (ipcmain.js).ApplicationProcessManager

Log Manager handles utility process outcome communication, for processes like loading configuration files,
handling local service requests from the ApplicationServiceManager, and relevant information logging for
debugging and development.

Service Manager handles local service requests from browser elements using a localized instance of a node
Express server object. This is responsible for fetching, parsing, and formatting stream data from the
(modules.js) module API, as well as locating and serving custom user widgets to local clients, and possibly
remote clients from the same local network (all in the future).

Process Manager handles the electron application, as well as inter-process communication (ipc) between the
renderer process - and its subprocesses - and the main application. Most of the control-flow is handled by
the process manager. The process manager is also responsible for handling the states of the Log and Service
Managers.

The application currently supports 

 	--- Continued Development ---

*02 widgix.js 		--	no content validation for located module and widget table maps during configuration.
*03 package.json	--	inaccurate github repository urls, both for issues and the general home page.
*04 index.html		--	no renderer process is loaded ( via ProcessManager.start() ). Build renderer application.
*05 logging.js 		--	Log Manager only prints logs to console. Needs debug file writing, more ipc with buildout.
*06 modules.js 		--	(modules.js).getStream acts as stub. No modules to load from, no process control-flow.
*07 express.js 		-- 	Does not serve widgets (/widget?name=<>). No widgets to serve.

There are certainly many more topics to address. They'll continue to become more specific as development continues.
